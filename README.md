# Candy Machine v3 UI Introduction
 Minting UI for a solana NFT collection. It works with **Candy Machine V3** and solana **solana-cli 1.14.3**. Other Candy Machine/solana cli combinations are not supported. 

 The base is from [wearekite](https://github.com/wearekite/candy-machine-v3-ui). It was adapted as needed. It is intended to be use with a NFT mint with different mint groups (eg. OG, Wl's and public).
